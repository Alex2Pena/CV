    <li>Hiking</li>
    <p>
      Since moving to the great Pacific Northwest back in 2015 I have grown to really appreciate the unspoiled natural beauty found in the surrounding areas here. Most of the hiking trails i frequent can be found in the       <strong><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range>Cascasde Mountian Range</a></strong> here in Washington.
      Occasionally I will venture off to Mt. Ranier National Park. Mt. Ranier is absolutly breathtaking and is where my favorite hike by far is located; it takes you to <strong><a href=https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/tolmie-peak-trail--2>Tolmie Peak Lookout</a></strong>

    </p>
    <li>Camping</li>
    <p>
    In 2018 my wife and I purchased a travel trailer so we could have more camping trips and opened up a whole new worrld of exploring the PNW.
